I have drawn bounding boxes around detected UI buttons. Each box is divided into 4 quadrants by a cross:

Quadrant 1 = Top-Left
Quadrant 2 = Top-Right  
Quadrant 3 = Bottom-Left
Quadrant 4 = Bottom-Right

The white dot shows where I think the center of each button is.

For each numbered button, please analyze:

1. **Coverage**: Does the bounding box cover the actual button? (yes/no/partial)
2. **Quadrants**: Which quadrants (1,2,3,4) contain part of the actual button?
3. **Center**: Is the white center dot on the actual button? (yes/no)
4. **Adjustments**: If needed, how should the box be moved or resized?

Please be very precise about which quadrants contain the actual button content.
