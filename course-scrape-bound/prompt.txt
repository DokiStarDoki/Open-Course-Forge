You are an expert at analyzing user interfaces for automation purposes. I need you to identify ALL clickable buttons, links, and interactive elements in this screenshot with PRECISE bounding boxes.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Only identify elements that are clearly visible and obviously clickable
2. Provide bounding boxes (rectangular areas) that fully contain each element
3. Be extremely precise with coordinates - I need these for automation scripts
4. Do not hallucinate or guess - only report what you can clearly see
5. Focus on elements that would be used for navigation or interaction

ELEMENTS TO LOOK FOR:
- Buttons (any shape, color, or style)
- Links (text links, navigation links)
- Icons that appear clickable (hamburger menus, close buttons, etc.)
- Navigation elements (tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination)
- Form elements (submit buttons, dropdown arrows)
- Interactive media controls (play buttons, etc.)
- Call-to-action elements

ELEMENTS TO IGNORE:
- Pure text content (unless it's clearly a link)
- Images that are not clickable
- Decorative elements
- Static UI elements

For each clickable element you find, provide a bounding box that fully contains the clickable area.

Return your response in this EXACT XML format (no additional text, no markdown, no explanations):

<detected_buttons>
<button>
<reference_name>blue_next_button</reference_name>
<description>Blue rectangular button with white 'Next' text in bottom right</description>
<element_type>button</element_type>
<confidence>95</confidence>
<bbox_x>750</bbox_x>
<bbox_y>380</bbox_y>
<bbox_width>120</bbox_width>
<bbox_height>40</bbox_height>
</button>
<button>
<reference_name>login_link</reference_name>
<description>Blue underlined text link saying 'Login' in top right corner</description>
<element_type>link</element_type>
<confidence>90</confidence>
<bbox_x>1170</bbox_x>
<bbox_y>40</bbox_y>
<bbox_width>60</bbox_width>
<bbox_height>20</bbox_height>
</button>
</detected_buttons>

<analysis_summary>
<total_elements_found>2</total_elements_found>
<image_description>Login page with blue theme, containing navigation and form elements</image_description>
</analysis_summary>

IMPORTANT: 
- bbox_x and bbox_y are the TOP-LEFT coordinates of the bounding box
- bbox_width and bbox_height are the width and height of the bounding box
- The bounding box should fully contain the entire clickable area
- Only return the XML structure above
- Do not include any explanatory text before or after the XML
- Do not use markdown code blocks or backticks
- Be as precise as possible with bounding boxes for automation accuracy
- If you cannot identify any clickable elements, return empty <detected_buttons></detected_buttons> tags
- Always include the analysis_summary section
